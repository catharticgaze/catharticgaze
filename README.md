Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Pedro, a Computer Science student at Rio de Janeiro State University. I speak Portuguese and English fluently.

As of now, I'm interested in learning python proficiently, and I want to work with AI in the future.

Also intent on learning more about C/C++ and Java.

Other things I enjoy doing besides programming:

- Studying anthropology, philosophy, & tech-related stuff
- Contemplating the marvels of the world
- Watching K-dramas
